# Dungeon Scrawl Vault

RPG maps using [Dungeon Scrawl](https://dungeonscrawl.com/) by [@ProbableTrain](https://twitter.com/probabletrain)

The maps have been created to be friendly to roll20 dynamic lighting. The walls are positioned to match with square corners in roll20: adding dynamic lighting should require minimal effort.

The maps have been exported from Dungeon Scrawl in .ds format. To use a map, either [download the repository](https://github.com/mathias-brandewinder/DungeonScrawlVault/archive/master.zip) or clone it, and import maps using file > load save file.

Feedback welcome :)
